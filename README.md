The game-changing text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs in OpenAI may set a new standard for voice activated software. Developers can increasingly benefit from proficiency with these APIs. Since its release, Whisper Model has completely disrupted the STT/TTS space. In this hands-on course, software developer and instructor Ronnie Sheer shows you how to leverage the voice APIs in OpenAI. Learn about voice models and the AI revolution. Get useful overviews of STT/TTS, then dive into actually building a small text reading web app and a pronunciation coach. ​​After completing this course, you will be able to incorporate STT/TTS capabilities into your software in genuinely meaningful and useful ways.
